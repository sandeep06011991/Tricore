# Tricore

The goal of this repository is to implement the paper 
" TriCore: Parallel Triangle Counting on GPUs". 

# Commit Structure.
 1. Setup on gypsum and download relevant graphs.
 2. Graph to datastructures.
 3. Graph in memory and gpu triangle counting implementation.
 4. Partition graph in csr
 5. Multi gpu triangle counting.
 6. Test MPI.
 7. Multi node multi-gpu working. 
 
 
 # Final deliverable. 
 
 1. GPU vs CPU implementation table
 2. Multi gpu time with worker stealing 
 3. Multi node scalability performance.


# Time investment expectation 5-10 days. 

# Finish reading CUDA handbook
